   35.5 out of 34 = 104.41% which is an A-plus

There are a couple of problems.  Everything works, but for your output on
the standalone tests you were supposed to output the count of each coin
denomination on a separate line as shown in class.  minus 1/2 point on the
EC tets.  For your error check of only one argument, you had an message
"Index 1 out of bounds for length 1" which is not informative like the
rest of your error handling.  I didn't take off any credit for that.
